This is autoencoder of feature engineering for Chinese book classification with pytorch.

Check how to build a vocabuary for your nlp process pipiline using pytorch from here :https://github.com/HIT-SCIR/plm-nlp-code/blob/main/chp4/vocab.py

Thanks very much for the authors of the links mentioned above.

How to use the codeï¼š

First the data should be have the followed format:

Second,when you have the dataset Run the file autoencoder_pytorch.py,save the encoder and vocab in your directory.


Third, use the encoder and vocab to generate(predict) the feature you wanted.
